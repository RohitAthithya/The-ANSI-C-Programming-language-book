/* the authors want to convey that there can be deficiencies in any code,
    there may be time when your code satisfies all boundary condtions except a few!

    may be even nobody would have thought about a scenario/situation like that

    once a great person said : "There often exists bogus input" you may some day be expected to somehow deal with it in a
