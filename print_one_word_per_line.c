Write a program that prints its input one word per line
*/
/*Soln.:
    when the character is inside the word we can print the word, else if we are outside the word
    say like blankspace or tabspace or newline then print a newline and also skip successive blanks 
    or tabspaces or newlines until a new ord is met

    this code is a combination of the word counting and the previous code of replaces the white spaces with one blank space!
