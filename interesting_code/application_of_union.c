// this type of application of Union is also called Bit Extraction using union and structure together
//3. Application of Union - we use a combiantion of both structure and union
//we have to take a 32 bit data and split it into multiple useful bits
/* what to do:
32 bits => 4 Bytes
 
=> split into 8 parts

  | CATEGORY       | No. Of bits  |  
  |-------------------------------|
  | address mode   | (1 bit)      | (left most bit) => base address + 31 bits
  | short address  | (2 bits)     |
  | long address   | (8 bits)     |
  | Sensor value   | (3 bits)     |
  | battery status | (3 bits)     |
  | Payload        |(12 bits)     |
  | status bit     | (1 bit)      |
  | CRC            | (2 bits)     |(right most bit) => base address
