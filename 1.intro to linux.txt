LINUX notes for c programming:

1. we open up the linux on virtual box
2. We use the terminal to execute commands
(IF YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF SOME EXECUTION ON THE TERMINAL => You press: ctrl+z)
3. i created a folder on the desktop named "c programs" using the grpahical user interface itseld

4. then i isntall some things
5. sudo apt-get install gcc
6. sudo apt update
7. sudo apt autoremove


--- now i had installed the gcc compilers, updated the machine and removed the overlapping or extra downloaded/installed files - not have gooten into the deeper meanings of these commands

	also i tried executing a python file in linux

	1. sudo apt-get python3

	this updated my python3 files from the internet

	2.gedit helloworld.py &

	this willopen up the the helloworld.py (text file) 
	i just typed the print("Hello world on linux")
	and typed the following on terminal
	3. python3 helloworld.py

	i got the expected output!

	shall we start doing some c programming

 --- i used:
 1. gedit "hello world.c" &
 
this opened up the text editor in the background, so i could edit the text file and input my c programs in it!

then i started with doing the execercise programs.

1. execute the helloworld programs while leaving out 1 and other parts and see what error we get

for \c as an input to the printf's string
it gives an error => unknown escape sequence!



i found this thing on quora => where we save 4 files that are generated during the preprocessing->compilation->linking->loading
it says to open the file named: filename.i
1. gcc -save-temps filename.c
