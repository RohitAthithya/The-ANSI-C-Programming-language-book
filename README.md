# The-ANSI-C-Programming-language-book
Hey all, I have been trying to read the ever gold : The K&amp;R C book's latest version by the legendary authors themselves. I received motivation to read this from my teach' . I guess I will follow along the reading and uploading of respective code or learnings from a reading session i had.  Another motive of mine is to learn to use GitHub by doing this. I suppose it is fun =)

I will commit to upload other example code here that i executed and variations that could be done in them, after I finish the book and upload the solutions of the exercises!

P.S.(after giving a small intro about why I am here and stuff): I kinda use some colloquial words like 'da' , 'ada dei' : these are are all Tamizh words, Let's say they are kinda like: 'Ah-ha' ,  'Alas'. May be even some gibberish words that i tell myself, of course in Tamizh-english style .
